Thetwo  pipelines:  Adversarial  Logging  Scoring  Pipeline(ALSP) and Requirements Feedback Scoring Pipeline(RFSP)  are  tested  with  multiple  use  cases,  such  as  awater  distribution  network  and  a  telecommunicationsnetwork,  to  illustrate  their  benefits.  ALSP  optimizesmodels using a game theory approach and it also logsand scores the actions of an AI model to detect adver-sarial  inputs,  and  assures  the  datasets  used  for  train-ing. RFSP identifies the best hyper-parameters using aBayesian  approach  and  provides  assurance  scores  forsubjective  goals  such  as  ethical  AI  using  user  inputsand  statistical  assurance  measures.  Each  pipeline  hasthree  methods  that  enforce  the  final  assurance  scoresand other outcomes. Unlike ALSP (which is a parallelprocess), RFSP is user-driven and its actions are sequen-tial. Data is collected for experimentation; the results ofboth pipelines are presented and contrasted.
